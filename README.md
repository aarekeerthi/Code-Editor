Custom Hook (useLocalStorage)

Manages state with localStorage persistence.

Purpose: The useLocalStorage hook manages state that persists in localStorage, ensuring that the state is saved and retrieved from localStorage whenever it changes.

Components:

Constants:

prefix: A string used to prefix the storage keys to avoid conflicts.

State Initialization:

Uses useState with an initializer function that:

Checks localStorage for an existing value.

Parses the value if it exists.

Uses the initialValue if no stored value is found, calling it if itâ€™s a function.

Effect:

Uses useEffect to update localStorage whenever the value changes.

Stores the updated value as a JSON string.

Return:

Returns the state value and the setter function [value, setValue] to allow components to read and update the state.
